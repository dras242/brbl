          <p>The Babe Ruth Memorial Baseball League (BRBL) is an APBA baseball computer league 
		  founded by Tony Lucio in 2011. All participants are required to use the 
          windows version of the APBA baseball game. In addition, all participants must purchase the current player disk on 
          an annual basis. There are no other required fees to join or participate.  
          </p>
          <p>The league uses APBA's Advanced Injury Management (A.I.M.) system 
		  to regulate player usage. Micromanagers are required to 
          manage the games for the away team. The league has 24 teams including 12 AL and 12 NL, 6 divisions of 4 teams
          each. The league is an affiliation league using 24 teams from MLB and each team has exclusive rights to 
          protect all debut players with their associated organization. Standard roster 
          size is 40 and teams can protect up to 34 players in preparation for the annual draft. Game roster size is 26. 
		  There is no interleague play between the AL (DH) and NL (no DH). The league 
		  conducts a full 162 game schedule along with a post season including wildcards.</p>
          <p>If you are interested in joining the league, please read the league's 
		  <a href="http://www.brbl-apba.com/docs/BRBL-Constitution.pdf" target="_blank">
		  Constitution</a>.</p>
